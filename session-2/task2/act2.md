# Task 2 - strings#

1. **String library**

The program `string_ops.c` requires you to test some C string library functions.

Note: 
- We declare the strings with space for additional characters
- Operations such as concatenation are "in place",
    - ie. they use the memory-space of the existing string and expect space to be available 

2. **Substring**

The code template 'substring.c' defines a small coding task.

You will need to look at documentation for the string library.

Complete the task following the instructions inside.

Print the final result in the following forms:
- memory location
- character
- string

Can you explain the result in each case, based on the documentation you used?
