# Activity 1 - static arrays#

1. Factorial

Create an integer array of length 20.
For each array entry, 0,1,2, compute the factorial of the array index.

`factorial(0) = 1`
`factorial(n) = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x ... x 2 x 1  for n>0`

Hint: note the recurrence relationship for factorial for the most efficient solution.

Question: Factorial becomes large very quickly. How many terms can be computed if the value is stored as an int?

2. Adding 2 vectors

Use a for loop to add the components of 2 vectors a and b.

3. Dot product of 2 vectors

The scalar product multiplies 2 vectors a and b with the formula

  `s = sum_k (a_k.b_k)`

Implement the scalar product using a for loop and test your code.
